/**
 * Who may call this server.
 *
 * The rule has two modes and the choice is the deployment's, not a request's:
 * with `MCP_API_KEY` set every call must present it, and with the key unset the
 * server answers anyone. The second mode exists because the intended deployment
 * is a Deployment behind a ClusterIP with no ingress — there the network is the
 * boundary, and a shared secret every pod already reaches adds a thing to rotate
 * without adding a thing it protects against.
 *
 * That reasoning depends entirely on the server not being reachable from
 * outside. `describeAuth` exists so the process says which mode it is in at
 * startup: the day someone puts an ingress in front of it, the log line is what
 * makes the open mode visible instead of silent.
